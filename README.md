 # Introduce
    
  I'm an artificial intelligence developer! I am interested in computer vision tasks. But, recently I conducted a Sounds detection project! I am intrigued that AI are game-changing in the world! and I love Pythorch, I like collaborating with diverse people and sharing their knowledge. I am interested in developing better solutions and learning new skills and tools as needed.
